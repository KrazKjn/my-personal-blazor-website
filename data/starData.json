    "Situation": "The company relied on a legacy Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application that was difficult to maintain, lacked modularity, and couldn’t scale across platforms.",
    "Task": "Architect and implement a modern Backend for Frontend (BFF) solution that would decouple the UI from backend logic and enable a responsive, maintainable frontend.",
    "Action": "Led the transition from WPF to a React-based frontend backed by C# .NET Core APIs. Scaffolded reusable components, implemented semantic CSS, and built a modular BFF layer that handled data shaping and legacy interop. Delivered a working proof of concept in five months while mentoring engineers through Razor/React syntax fixes and UI/UX modularity.",
    "Result": "Modernized the application, improved performance and maintainability, and laid the foundation for iterative feature delivery and legacy storytelling.",
