    "TextBody": "Mark is a problem solver. Even when we have super complicated solutions to build, Mark finds a way to break then down into individual pieces. He also is a forward thinker. Mark doesn't built solutions just for what you're asking for today, but also what you may ask for in the future. Because of this methodology, we often find ourselves having features already built which can be utilized for new initiatives. Always a pleasure to work with Mark.",
